# Introduction

Wanderer.js is an easy to use, user-onboarding library. It is still in its early stages so more work needs to be done, but at this stage it is still quite functional. Some features it already has include:

- Tooltips
- Theming
- Smart auto-positioning
- Multi-page support

Since Wanderer.js is still at such an early stage, the early adopters will have a lot of say in regards to which features they want in upcoming releases. Things that are already on the roadmap include:

- Modals - (For the introductory/final step of a Trip)
- Analytics integrations
- Tooltip WYSIWYG builder
- More themes
- User surveys

## Why does this exist

Based on my research, there are two types of solutions in this space. One option is geared more towards companies/enterprises like Appcues, Walkme, etc.) and the other options is small open source libraries like Intro.js or ShepherdJS.

When it comes to the commercial offerings, the price is way too steep for individual developers, or small companies just starting out. So while they are very feature rich, they're simply not an option. On the other hand, open source libraries are generally lacking core features and come out of the box looking quite ugly.

I intend on turning Wanderer.js into a hybrid of these two options. Creating a feature rich, user onboarding library (that's not just tooltips) that also looks nice right off the bat.

## Name

Wanderer.js

# Descrtiption

Wanderer.js is an easy-to user, customizable user-onboarding library

# Motivation

I created Wanderer.js for 3 main reasons.

1. I constantly make new websites, and the one thing that they always need is some form of onboarding to show users what to do.
2. I can't afford the exorbitant prices the existing commercial tools charge
3. The existing open source libraries create tooltips that don't look very nice (in my opinion) and were missing some crucial functionality

# Features

Currently, the only onboarding UI element that Wanderer.js is able to create are tooltips, and it does that very well (IMHO). In the future I plan on adding

1. Modals (For the introduction screen)
2. Hotspots (As indicators for where to click)

Within tooltips however there are tons of customizability options which well get into now.
